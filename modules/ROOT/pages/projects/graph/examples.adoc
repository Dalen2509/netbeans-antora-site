There are a number of examples that can be used as a guide for writing code to the NetBeans Visual Library.

You will need to clone mercurial repository and get example from visual.examples folder

link:http://source.apidesign.org/hg/netbeans/contrib/file/tip/visual.examples[Simple NetBeans Application Project]

This will produce a NetBeans Java Application project. Open it in NetBeans IDE. A long list of examples, the first few of which are shown below, will be available.

image::projects/graph/visual-samples.png[Visual Samples]

Simply run the project. A dialog containing a list of all the examples will appear. 
Double-click any of the items in the list to run the example. 
Note that all the supporting code for the examples is in the project. 
This is a good source for learning how to use the NetBeans Visual Library APIs.
