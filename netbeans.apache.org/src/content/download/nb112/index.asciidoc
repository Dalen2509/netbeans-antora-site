Apache NetBeans 11.2 is the second Apache NetBeans release outside the Apache Incubator and the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Release+Schedule[second release of the new quarterly release cycle].

TIP: The LTS release of the Apache NetBeans 11 cycle is Apache NetBeans 11.0. The 11.1 and 11.2 releases have not been tested as heavily as the LTS release and may therefore be less stable. Use 11.2 to use the latest features and to provide feedback for the next LTS release, scheduled for April 2020. Go here to download  link:/download/nb110/nb110.html[Apache NetBeans 11.0], the current LTS release.

== Release Drivers

=== Java

The highlights of enhancements in the Java area are focused on support for JDK 13.

TIP: link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12[JEP 12] provides for a preview language or VM feature, which "is a new feature of the Java SE Platform that is fully specified, fully implemented, and yet impermanent. It is available in a JDK feature release to provoke developer feedback based on real world use; this may lead to it becoming permanent in a future Java SE Platform".

Preview features can only be used if the Java compiler's "--enable-preview" flag is set, as shown below for Maven.

== Notes

- The donation of the NetBeans C and C&#x2b;&#x2b; features from Oracle to Apache was not complete at the time of the 11.2 release, though it is not far off, and the 11.3 release (January 2020) is scheduled to focus primarily on the integration of the C and C++ features, once they land in the Apache NetBeans GitHub. Until then, go to the Plugin Manager, enable the NetBeans IDE 8.2 Update Center, which lets you install the NetBeans IDE 8.2 modules providing C and C&#x2b;&#x2b; features.
- WildFly integration is supported by means of the link:http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/76472/wildfly-application-server[WildFly Application Server] plugin located in the Plugin Portal.
- Support for JSF 2.3 is available as a pull request, too late for inclusion in 11.2, scheduled for 11.3: link:https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1576[https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1576]
