Welcome to Apache NetBeans 12.0 is the LTS release for 2020 of the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Release+Schedule[Apache NetBeans quarterly release cycle].

TIP: The LTS release of the Apache NetBeans 12 cycle is Apache NetBeans 12.0, which consolidates the feature releases 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3. Feature releases have not been tested as heavily as the LTS release, which passes through the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Results+from+Apache+NetBeans+IDE+12.0+Community+Acceptance+survey[NetCAT Community Acceptance process] and is for these reasons the annual major release.

Below are the highlights of Apache NetBeans 12.0, for a full list, see the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+12.0[Apache NetBeans 12.0 Wiki].

== Java

The highlights of the enhancements in the Java area are focused on support for the latest Java language features.

=== Java Language Features

==== Java 14

- link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359[JEP 359]: Records (Preview Feature) -- syntax coloring for the new "record" keyword; Navigator shows equals, hashCode, toString, etc; and formatting support for records.

--  

TIP: link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12[JEP 12] provides for a preview language or VM feature, which "is a new feature of the Java SE Platform that is fully specified, fully implemented, and yet impermanent. It is available in a JDK feature release to provoke developer feedback based on real world use; this may lead to it becoming permanent in a future Java SE Platform".

Preview features can only be used if the Java compiler's `--enable-preview` flag is set, as shown below for Maven. 

[source,xml]
----
<build>
   <plugins>
      <plugin>
          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.8.0</version>
          <configuration>
              <compilerArgs>
                    <arg>--enable-preview</arg>
              </compilerArgs>
         </configuration>
     </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

An example to add `--enable-preview` in Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
tasks.withType(JavaCompile).each {
    it.options.compilerArgs.add('--enable-preview')
}

run.jvmArgs(['--enable-preview'])
----

TIP: To use the latest Java language features, such as the new "record" keyword, in the Java Editor, you'll need to run Apache NetBeans itself on the JDK that provides those features, so that Apache NetBeans will use the Java compiler from the JDK it runs on for code recognition, syntax coloring, etc. In these scenarios, make sure to uninstall nb-javac, if it is installed, and not to install and use it, when prompted, so that the Java compiler from JDK will be used, rather than nb-javac, which does not support the latest Java language features and is mandatory only when you run Apache NetBeans on JDK 8.

Other enhancements in the Java area.

- link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330]: Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs -- single Java source files can be created, outside of projects, in the Favorites window, and they can be run and debugged, if NetBeans is running on JDK 11 or later.
 
- link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355[JEP 355]: Text Blocks (Preview) -- in addition to the Text Block features introduced to the Java Editor in previous releases, a new Java editor hint has been introduced for reverting from Text Block to String. 

=== JavaFX

=== Java EE

=== Java Build Systems

==== Maven

==== Gradle

== PHP

== C/C++

== Miscellaneous

- Fixed link:https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2076[incorrectly positioned line-width marker] (i.e., shown at 82 characters instead of 80 characters), and inaccurate tab alignments. This bug existed at certain editor zoom levels on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, including on non-HiDPI screens.

- Fixed link:https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2025[clipped file names] in Projects window and Files window on Windows on HiDPI screens.
