Apache NetBeans 11.3 is the third Apache NetBeans release outside the Apache Incubator and the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Release+Schedule[third release of the new quarterly release cycle].

TIP: The LTS release of the Apache NetBeans 11 cycle is Apache NetBeans 11.0. The 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 releases have not been tested as heavily as the LTS release and may therefore be less stable. Use 11.3 to use the latest features and to provide feedback for the next LTS release, scheduled for April 2020. Go here to download  link:/download/nb110/nb110.html[Apache NetBeans 11.0], the current LTS release.

== Release Drivers

=== Java

The highlights of enhancements in the Java area are focused on support for JDK 14.

- link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359[JEP 359]: Records (Preview Feature) -- syntax coloring for the new "record" keyword; Navigator shows equals, hashCode, toString, etc; and formatting support for records.

TIP: link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12[JEP 12] provides for a preview language or VM feature, which "is a new feature of the Java SE Platform that is fully specified, fully implemented, and yet impermanent. It is available in a JDK feature release to provoke developer feedback based on real world use; this may lead to it becoming permanent in a future Java SE Platform".

Preview features can only be used if the Java compiler's `--enable-preview` flag is set, as shown below for Maven. 

[source,xml]
----
<build>
   <plugins>
      <plugin>
          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.8.0</version>
          <configuration>
              <compilerArgs>
                    <arg>--enable-preview</arg>
              </compilerArgs>
         </configuration>
     </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

An example to add `--enable-preview` in Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
tasks.withType(JavaCompile).each {
    it.options.compilerArgs.add('--enable-preview')
}

run.jvmArgs(['--enable-preview'])
----

Other enhancements in the Java area.

- link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330]: Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs -- single Java source files can be created, outside of projects, in the Favorites window, and they can be run and debugged, if NetBeans is running on JDK 11 or later.
